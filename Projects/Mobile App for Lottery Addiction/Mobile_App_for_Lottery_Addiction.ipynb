    "### Next Steps\n",
    "That was all for the guided part of the project! We managed to write four main functions for our app:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `one_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket\n",
    "- `check_historical_occurrence()` — checks whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery data set\n",
    "- `multi_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability for any number of of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816\n",
    "- `probability_less_6()` — calculates the probability of having two, three, four or five winning numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible features for a second version of the app include:\n",
    "- Making the outputs even easier to understand by adding fun analogies (for example, we can find probabilities for strange events and compare with the chances of winning in lottery; for instance, we can output something along the lines \"You are 100 times more likely to be the victim of a shark attack than winning the lottery\").\n",
    "- Combining the `one_ticket_probability()` and `check_historical_occurrence()` to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time.\n",
    "- Creating a function similar to probability_less_6() which calculates the probability of having at least two, three, four or five winning numbers. Hint: the number of successful outcomes for having at least four winning numbers is the sum of these three numbers:\n",
    "    - The number of successful outcomes for having four winning numbers exactly\n",
    "    - The number of successful outcomes for having five winning numbers exactly\n",
    "    - The number of successful outcomes for having six winning numbers exactly\n",
